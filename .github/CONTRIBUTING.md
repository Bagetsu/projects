- `intermediate`: Projects that are for less experienced programmers. These projects should contain some more difficult concepts, but should still be understandable by most programmers. 
- `advanced`: Projects that are for experienced programmers. Projects can contain advanced concepts and paradigms.

## Formatting

- Subheadings are title cased: Setting Up
- File names are bolded: **hello_world.py**
